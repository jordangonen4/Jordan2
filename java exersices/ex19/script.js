// questionA(): bob will be first. sequenceA` logs "Bob" immediately because it's a regular synchronous function. The `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 still queues the "Sponge" log in the event loop, but it is logged after "Bob."
// questionB(): Promise.resolve().then() logs Promise at B in the microtask queue, and it is executed before The `setTimeout` method 
// questionC():Promise.resolve().then() logs Promise at C in the microtask queue, and it is executed before The `setTimeout` method 
// questionD():"Sponge" is logged immediately because it's a regular synchronous function. "Bob" comes after because it's also a regular synchronous function, than Promise.resolve().then(...) that prints pants and square will be in the end 
// questionE():sequenceB and sequenceC are executed in order. For both `sequenceB` and `sequenceC`, the " Promise" logs are executed in the microtask queue before the " Timeout" logs in the task queue
